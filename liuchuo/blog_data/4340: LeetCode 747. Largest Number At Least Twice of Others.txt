<p>In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.</p><p>Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.</p><p>If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.</p><p>Example 1:<br>Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]<br>Output: 1<br>Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x,<br>6 is more than twice as big as x. The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.<br>Example 2:<br>Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]<br>Output: -1<br>Explanation: 4 isn’t at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.<br>Note:<br>nums will have a length in the range [1, 50].<br>Every nums[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 99].</p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：找到最大值maxn、它对应的下标idx和次大值sec，如果次大值sec的两倍比maxn大说明不满足条件返回-1，否则返回idx</strong></span></p><p></p>

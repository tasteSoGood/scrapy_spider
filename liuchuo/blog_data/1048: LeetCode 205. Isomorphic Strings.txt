<p>Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.</p><p>Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.</p><p>All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.</p><p>For example,<br>Given “egg”, “add”, return true.</p><p>Given “foo”, “bar”, return false.</p><p>Given “paper”, “title”, return true.</p><p>Note:<br>You may assume both s and t have the same length.</p><p> </p>

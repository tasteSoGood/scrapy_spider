<p>Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.</p><p>For example,<br>Given 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4, you should return the list as 2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;3.</p><p>Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.</p><p>Â </p>

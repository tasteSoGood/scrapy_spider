<p>For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page’s size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:</p><p>1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.</p><p>2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L &gt;= W.</p><p>3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.<br>You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.<br>Example:<br>Input: 4<br>Output: [2, 2]<br>Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].<br>But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3, [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.<br>Note:<br>The given area won’t exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer<br>The web page’s width and length you designed must be positive integers.</p><p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>题目大意：给定area，求长和宽，使得长方形面积等于area，要求长&gt;=宽并且长和宽之间的大小差距尽可能小～～</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：先令长l和宽w等于sqrt(area), 如果长x宽得到的面积不等于area，稍微调整l和w的大小：如果面积小了，将长+1；如果面积大了，将宽-1。直到最后l * w == area为止～</strong></span></p><p> </p>

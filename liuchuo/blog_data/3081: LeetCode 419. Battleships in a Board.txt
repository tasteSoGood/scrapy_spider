<p>Given an 2D board, count how many different battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with ‘X’s, empty slots are represented with ‘.’s. You may assume the following rules:</p><p>You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.<br>Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.<br>At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships – there are no adjacent battleships.<br>Example:<br>X..X<br>…X<br>…X<br>In the above board there are 2 battleships.<br>Invalid Example:<br>…X<br>XXXX<br>…X<br>This is an invalid board that you will not receive – as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.</p><p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>题目大意：给一张地图，战列舰用X表示，空地用.表示，战列舰只可能横着或者竖着一条，而且两条战列舰之间肯定有空地，计算战列舰的个数～</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：其实只需要数战列舰的头部有几个就行了，因为战列舰要么横着要么竖着，它的头部肯定满足以下条件：1.它的上方是空地（或者边界） 2.它的左方是空地（或者边界）</strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>这样遍历一遍地图上所有的点，如果当前点是X而且满足上面所述的两个条件，就将战列舰个数+1～～～</strong></span></p><p> </p>

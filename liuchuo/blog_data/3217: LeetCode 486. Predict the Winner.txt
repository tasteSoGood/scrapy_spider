<p>Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.</p><p>Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.</p><p>Example 1:<br>Input: [1, 5, 2]<br>Output: False<br>Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2.<br>If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).<br>So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5.<br>Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.<br>Example 2:<br>Input: [1, 5, 233, 7]<br>Output: True<br>Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.<br>Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.<br>Note:<br>1 &lt;= length of the array &lt;= 20.<br>Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed 10,000,000.<br>If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.</p><p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>题目大意：给一个整型数组，两个人依次从数组中的头或者尾拿一个数，判断是否player1拿到的总数大于或者等于player2～如果是就返回true，否则返回false～</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：动态规划解决～建立dp[len][len]数组，dp[i][j]表示nums数组中i～j下标间player1能够获得的分数-player2能够获得的分数～最后dp[0][len-1]的正负性即可表明player1是否能赢～</strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>dp[0][len-1]的值通过递归动态规划可得：func(begin, end)返回dp[begin][end]的值，当begin和end相等的时候，dp[begin][end]的值即为nums[begin]（或者nums[end]），如果begin和end不等，那么如果取begin，结果为nums[begin] – dp[begin+1][end]; 如果取end，结果为nums[end] – dp[begin][end-1]，dp[begin][end]取它俩中较大的一个～</strong></span></p><p> </p>

<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Sherlock Holmes received a note with some strange strings: “Let’s date! 3485djDkxh4hhGE 2984akDfkkkkggEdsb s&amp;hgsfdk d&amp;Hyscvnm”. It took him only a minute to figure out that those strange strings are actually referring to the coded time “Thursday 14:04” — since the first common capital English letter (case sensitive) shared by the first two strings is the 4th capital letter ‘D’, representing the 4th day in a week; the second common character is the 5th capital letter ‘E’, representing the 14th hour (hence the hours from 0 to 23 in a day are represented by the numbers from 0 to 9 and the capital letters from A to N, respectively); and the English letter shared by the last two strings is ‘s’ at the 4th position, representing the 4th minute. Now given two pairs of strings, you are supposed to help Sherlock decode the dating time.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Input Specification:</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Each input file contains one test case.

It is guaranteed that the result is unique for each case.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Sample Input:</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>3485djDkxh4hhGE </strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>2984akDfkkkkggEdsb </strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>s&amp;hgsfdk </strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>d&amp;Hyscvnm</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Sample Output:</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>THU 14:04<br></strong></span></p><p> </p>

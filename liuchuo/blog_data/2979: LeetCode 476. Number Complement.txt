<p>Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.</p><p>Note:<br>The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.<br>You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.<br>Example 1:<br>Input: 5<br>Output: 2<br>Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.<br>Example 2:<br>Input: 1<br>Output: 0<br>Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.</p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：mask – 1为和num二进制位等长的所有位数为1的数，与num取^可以得到和num相反的数字。</strong></span></p><p> </p>

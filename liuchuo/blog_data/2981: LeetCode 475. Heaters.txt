<p>Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.</p><p>Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.</p><p>So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.</p><p>Note:<br>Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.<br>Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.<br>As long as a house is in the heaters‘ warm radius range, it can be warmed.<br>All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.<br>Example 1:<br>Input: [1,2,3],[2]<br>Output: 1<br>Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.<br>Example 2:<br>Input: [1,2,3,4],[1,4]<br>Output: 1<br>Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.</p><p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>题目大意：给出房子的坐标和供暖器的坐标，求供暖器的最小供热半径是多少才能满足让所有房子都暖和。</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：先将houses和heaters排序，计算每一个house左右的供暖器的距离最小的那个值，然后将所有的这些最小值中取最大的值。</strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>因为houses和heaters都是排序好的，所以heater[j]与houses[i]的距离应该越来越小，如果突然间变大了，说明不是最小值了，就break掉。这样就能得知最小值。</strong></span></p><p> </p>

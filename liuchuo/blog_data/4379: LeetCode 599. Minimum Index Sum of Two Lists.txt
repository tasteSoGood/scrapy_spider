<p>Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.</p><p>You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.</p><p>Example 1:<br>Input:<br>[“Shogun”, “Tapioca Express”, “Burger King”, “KFC”]<br>[“Piatti”, “The Grill at Torrey Pines”, “Hungry Hunter Steakhouse”, “Shogun”]<br>Output: [“Shogun”]<br>Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is “Shogun”.<br>Example 2:<br>Input:<br>[“Shogun”, “Tapioca Express”, “Burger King”, “KFC”]<br>[“KFC”, “Shogun”, “Burger King”]<br>Output: [“Shogun”]<br>Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is “Shogun” with index sum 1 (0+1).<br>Note:<br>The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].<br>The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].<br>The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.<br>No duplicates in both lists.</p><p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>题目大意：假设安迪和多丽丝想选择一家餐厅吃饭，他们有一串最喜欢的餐厅名单。你需要帮助他们用最小的指数总和找到他们的共同兴趣。 如果答案有多个则没有顺序要求地返回所有答案在string数组中～</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：当i+j比minSum小时将数组清空，minSum赋值为i+j，list1[i]放入ans数组中</strong></span></p><p></p>

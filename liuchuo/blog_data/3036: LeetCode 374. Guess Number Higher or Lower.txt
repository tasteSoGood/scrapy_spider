<p>We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:</p><p>I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.</p><p>Every time you guess wrong, I’ll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.</p><p>You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):</p><p>-1 : My number is lower<br>1 : My number is higher<br>0 : Congrats! You got it!<br>Example:<br>n = 10, I pick 6.</p><p>Return 6.</p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：二分查找法解决，不过要注意mid = low + (high – low) / 2 不要写成 mid = (low + high) / 2 ，后者超过了Int类型的最大值，相加变成负数，会导致超时～～</strong></span></p><p> </p>

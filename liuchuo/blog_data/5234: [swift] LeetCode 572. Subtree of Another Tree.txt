<p>Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this nodeâ€™s descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.</p><p>Example 1:<br>Given tree s:</p><p>3<br>/ \\<br>4 5<br>/ \\<br>1 2<br>Given tree t:<br>4<br>/ \\<br>1 2<br>Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.<br>Example 2:<br>Given tree s:</p><p>3<br>/ \\<br>4 5<br>/ \\<br>1 2<br>/<br>0<br>Given tree t:<br>4<br>/ \\<br>1 2<br>Return false.</p><p></p>

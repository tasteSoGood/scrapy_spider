<p>Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, …, n, find the one that is missing from the array.</p><p>For example,<br>Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.</p><p>Note:<br>Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?</p><p> </p>

<p>Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.</p><p>Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.</p><p>Examples:<br>pattern = “abba”, str = “dog cat cat dog” should return true.<br>pattern = “abba”, str = “dog cat cat fish” should return false.<br>pattern = “aaaa”, str = “dog cat cat dog” should return false.<br>pattern = “abba”, str = “dog dog dog dog” should return false.<br>Notes:<br>You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.</p><p></p>

<p>Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.</p><p>push(x) — Push element x onto stack.<br>pop() — Removes the element on top of the stack.<br>top() — Get the top element.<br>empty() — Return whether the stack is empty.<br>Notes:<br>You must use only standard operations of a queue — which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.<br>Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.<br>You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).<br>Update (2015-06-11):<br>The class name of the Java function had been updated to MyStack instead of Stack.</p><p></p>

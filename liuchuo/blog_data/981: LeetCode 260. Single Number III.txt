<p>Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].</p><p>Note:<br>The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.<br>Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?</p><p>Â </p>

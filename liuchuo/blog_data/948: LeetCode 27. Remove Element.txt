<p>Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.</p><p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.</p><p>The order of elements can be changed. It does not matter what you leave beyond the new length.</p><p>Example:<br>Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3</p><p>Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.</p><p>Â </p>

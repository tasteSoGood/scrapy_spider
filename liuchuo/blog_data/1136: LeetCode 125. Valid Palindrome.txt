<p>Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.</p><p>For example,<br>“A man, a plan, a canal: Panama” is a palindrome.<br>“race a car” is not a palindrome.</p><p>Note:<br>Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.</p><p>For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.</p><p></p>

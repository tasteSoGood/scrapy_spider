<p>Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.</p><p>For example:<br>Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,<br>5<br>/ \\<br>4 8<br>/ / \\<br>11 13 4<br>/ \\ \\<br>7 2 1<br>return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5-&gt;4-&gt;11-&gt;2 which sum is 22.</p><p>Â </p>

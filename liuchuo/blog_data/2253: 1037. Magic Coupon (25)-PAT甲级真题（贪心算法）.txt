<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>The magic shop in Mars is offering some magic coupons. Each coupon has an integer N printed on it, meaning that when you use this coupon with a product, you may get N times the value of that product back! What is more, the shop also offers some bonus product for free. However, if you apply a coupon with a positive N to this bonus product, you will have to pay the shop N times the value of the bonus product… but hey, magically, they have some coupons with negative N’s!</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>For example, given a set of coupons {1 2 4 -1}, and a set of product values {7 6 -2 -3} (in Mars dollars M$) where a negative value corresponds to a bonus product. You can apply coupon 3 (with N being 4) to product 1 (with value M$7) to get M$28 back; coupon 2 to product 2 to get M$12 back; and coupon 4 to product 4 to get M$3 back. On the other hand, if you apply coupon 3 to product 4, you will have to pay M$12 to the shop.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Each coupon and each product may be selected at most once. Your task is to get as much money back as possible.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Input Specification:</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains the number of coupons NC, followed by a line with NC coupon integers. Then the next line contains the number of products NP, followed by a line with NP product values. Here 1&lt;= NC, NP &lt;= 105, and it is guaranteed that all the numbers will not exceed 230.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Output Specification:</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>For each test case, simply print in a line the maximum amount of money you can get back.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Sample Input:</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>4</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>1 2 4 -1</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>4</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>7 6 -2 -3</strong></span><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Sample Output:</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>43</strong></span><br><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>题目大意：给出两个数字序列，从这两个序列中分别选取相同数量的元素进行一对一相乘，问能得到的乘积之和最大为多少～</strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：把这两个序列都从小到大排序，将前面都是负数的数相乘求和，然后将后面都是正数的数相乘求和～</strong></span></p><p> </p>

<p>Example1: x = 123, return 321<br>Example2: x = -123, return -321</p><p>Have you thought about this?<br>Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!</p><p>If the integer’s last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.</p><p>Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?</p><p>For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.</p><p>Update (2014-11-10):<br>Test cases had been added to test the overflow behavior.</p><p> </p>

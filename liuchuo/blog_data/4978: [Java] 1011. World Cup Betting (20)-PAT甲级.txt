<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>1011. World Cup Betting (20)</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>With the 2010 FIFA World Cup running, football fans the world over were becoming increasingly excited as the best players from the best teams doing battles for the World Cup trophy in South Africa. Similarly, football betting fans were putting their money where their mouths were, by laying all manner of World Cup bets.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Chinese Football Lottery provided a “Triple Winning” game. The rule of winning was simple: first select any three of the games. Then for each selected game, bet on one of the three possible results — namely W for win, T for tie, and L for lose. There was an odd assigned to each result. The winner’s odd would be the product of the three odds times 65%.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>For example, 3 games’ odds are given as the following:</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>W T L</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>1.1 2.5 1.7</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>1.2 3.0 1.6</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>4.1 1.2 1.1</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>To obtain the maximum profit, one must buy W for the 3rd game, T for the 2nd game, and T for the 1st game. If each bet takes 2 yuans, then the maximum profit would be (4.1*3.0*2.5*65%-1)*2 = 37.98 yuans (accurate up to 2 decimal places).</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Input</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains the betting information of 3 games. Each game occupies a line with three distinct odds corresponding to W, T and L.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Output</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>For each test case, print in one line the best bet of each game, and the maximum profit accurate up to 2 decimal places. The characters and the number must be separated by one space.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Sample Input</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>1.1 2.5 1.7</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>1.2 3.0 1.6</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>4.1 1.2 1.1</strong></span><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Sample Output</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>T T W 37.98</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong><span style="color: #ff99cc;">PS：感谢github用户<a style="color: #ff99cc;" href="https://github.com/fs19910227">@fs19910227</a>提供的pull request～</span></strong></span></p><p> </p>

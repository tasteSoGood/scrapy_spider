<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Formation is very important when taking a group photo. Given the rules of forming K rows with N people as the following:</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>The number of people in each row must be N/K (round down to the nearest integer), with all the extra people (if any) standing in the last row;</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>All the people in the rear row must be no shorter than anyone standing in the front rows;</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>In each row, the tallest one stands at the central position (which is defined to be the position (m/2+1), where m is the total number of people in that row, and the division result must be rounded down to the nearest integer);</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>In each row, other people must enter the row in non-increasing order of their heights, alternately taking their positions first to the right and then to the left of the tallest one (For example, given five people with their heights 190, 188, 186, 175, and 170, the final formation would be 175, 188, 190, 186, and 170. Here we assume that you are facing the group so your left-hand side is the right-hand side of the one at the central position.);</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>When there are many people having the same height, they must be ordered in alphabetical (increasing) order of their names, and it is guaranteed that there is no duplication of names.</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Now given the information of a group of people, you are supposed to write a program to output their formation.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Input Specification:</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Each input file contains one test case. For each test case, the first line contains two positive integers N (&lt;=10000), the total number of people, and K (&lt;=10), the total number of rows. Then N lines follow, each gives the name of a person (no more than 8 English letters without space) and his/her height (an integer in [30, 300]).</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Output Specification:</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>For each case, print the formation — that is, print the names of people in K lines. The names must be separated by exactly one space, but there must be no extra space at the end of each line. Note: since you are facing the group, people in the rear rows must be printed above the people in the front rows.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Sample Input:</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>10 3</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Tom 188</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Mike 170</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Eva 168</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Tim 160</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Joe 190</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Ann 168</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Bob 175</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Nick 186</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Amy 160</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>John 159</strong></span><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Sample Output:</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Bob Tom Joe Nick</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Ann Mike Eva</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Tim Amy John<br></strong></span></p><p> </p>

<p>A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.</p><p>Given an input array where num[i] ≠ num[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.</p><p>The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.</p><p>You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -∞.</p><p>For example, in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.</p><p> </p>

<p>Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.</p><p>Some hints:<br>Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)</p><p>If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.</p><p>You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem “Reverse Integer”, you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?</p><p>There is a more generic way of solving this problem.</p><p></p>

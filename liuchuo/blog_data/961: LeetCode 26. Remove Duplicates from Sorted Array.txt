<p>Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.</p><p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.</p><p>For example,<br>Given input array nums = [1,1,2],</p><p>Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the new length.</p><p></p>

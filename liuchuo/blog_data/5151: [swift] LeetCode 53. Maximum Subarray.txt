<p><strong>Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.</strong><br><strong>For example, given the array [−2,1,−3,4,−1,2,1,−5,4],</strong><br><strong>the contiguous subarray [4,−1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.</strong><br><strong>click to show more practice.</strong><br><strong>More practice:</strong><br><strong>If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.</strong></p><p></p>

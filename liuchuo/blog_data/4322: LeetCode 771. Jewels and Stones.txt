<p>You are given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.</p><p>The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so “a” is considered a different type of stone from “A”.</p><p>Example 1:</p><p>Input: J = “aA”, S = “aAAbbbb”<br>Output: 3<br>Example 2:</p><p>Input: J = “z”, S = “ZZ”<br>Output: 0<br>Note:</p><p>S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.<br>The characters in J are distinct.</p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>题目大意：J是珠宝，S是自己拥有的石头，判断自己拥有的石头中有多少个珠宝～</strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong> 分析：将J中的所有字符在hash数组中标记为1，再遍历S，统计hash == 1的个数即为所求～</strong></span></p><p> </p>

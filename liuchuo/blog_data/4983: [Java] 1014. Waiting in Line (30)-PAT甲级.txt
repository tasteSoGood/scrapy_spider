<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Suppose a bank has N windows open for service. There is a yellow line in front of the windows which devides the waiting area into two parts. The rules for the customers to wait in line are:</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>The space inside the yellow line in front of each window is enough to contain a line with M customers. Hence when all the N lines are full, all the customers after (and including) the (NM+1)st one will have to wait in a line behind the yellow line.</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Each customer will choose the shortest line to wait in when crossing the yellow line. If there are two or more lines with the same length, the customer will always choose the window with the smallest number.</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Customer[i] will take T[i] minutes to have his/her transaction processed.</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>The first N customers are assumed to be served at 8:00am.</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Now given the processing time of each customer, you are supposed to tell the exact time at which a customer has his/her business done.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>For example, suppose that a bank has 2 windows and each window may have 2 custmers waiting inside the yellow line. There are 5 customers waiting with transactions taking 1, 2, 6, 4 and 3 minutes, respectively. At 08:00 in the morning, customer1 is served at window1 while customer2 is served at window2. Customer3 will wait in front of window1 and customer4 will wait in front of window2. Customer5 will wait behind the yellow line.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>At 08:01, customer1 is done and customer5 enters the line in front of window1 since that line seems shorter now. Customer2 will leave at 08:02, customer4 at 08:06, customer3 at 08:07, and finally customer5 at 08:10.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Input</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 4 positive integers: N (&lt;=20, number of windows), M (&lt;=10, the maximum capacity of each line inside the yellow line), K (&lt;=1000, number of customers), and Q (&lt;=1000, number of customer queries).</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>The next line contains K positive integers, which are the processing time of the K customers.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>The last line contains Q positive integers, which represent the customers who are asking about the time they can have their transactions done. The customers are numbered from 1 to K.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Output</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>For each of the Q customers, print in one line the time at which his/her transaction is finished, in the format HH:MM where HH is in [08, 17] and MM is in [00, 59]. Note that since the bank is closed everyday after 17:00, for those customers who cannot be served before 17:00, you must output “Sorry” instead.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Sample Input</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>2 2 7 5</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>1 2 6 4 3 534 2</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>3 4 5 6 7</strong></span><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Sample Output</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>08:07</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>08:06</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>08:10</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>17:00</strong></span><br><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Sorry</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>题目大意：n个窗口，每个窗口可以排队m人。有k位用户需要服务，给出了每位用户需要的minute数，所有客户在8点开始服务，如果有窗口还没排满就入队，否则就在黄线外等候。如果有某一列有一个用户走了服务完毕了，黄线外的人就进来一个。如果同时就选窗口数小的。求q个人的服务结束时间。</strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>如果一个客户在17:00以及以后还没有开始服务（此处不是结束服务是开始17:00）就不再服务输出sorry；如果这个服务已经开始了，无论时间多长都要等他服务完毕</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #ff99cc;"><strong>PS：感谢github用户<a style="color: #ff99cc;" href="https://github.com/fs19910227">@fs19910227</a>提供的pull request～</strong></span></p><p> </p>

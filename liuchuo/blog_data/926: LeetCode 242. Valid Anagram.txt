<p>Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.</p><p>For example,<br>s = “anagram”, t = “nagaram”, return true.<br>s = “rat”, t = “car”, return false.</p><p>Note:<br>You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.</p><p>Follow up:<br>What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?</p><p> </p>

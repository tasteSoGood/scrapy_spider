<p>Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.<br>For example, the following two linked lists:</p><p>A: a1 → a2<br>↘<br>c1 → c2 → c3<br>↗<br>B: b1 → b2 → b3<br>begin to intersect at node c1.<br>Notes:</p><p>If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.<br>The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.<br>You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.<br>Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.</p><p> </p>

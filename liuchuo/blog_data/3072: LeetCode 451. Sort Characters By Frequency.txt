<p>Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.</p><p>Example 1:</p><p>Input:<br>“tree”</p><p>Output:<br>“eert”</p><p>Explanation:<br>‘e’ appears twice while ‘r’ and ‘t’ both appear once.<br>So ‘e’ must appear before both ‘r’ and ‘t’. Therefore “eetr” is also a valid answer.<br>Example 2:</p><p>Input:<br>“cccaaa”</p><p>Output:<br>“cccaaa”</p><p>Explanation:<br>Both ‘c’ and ‘a’ appear three times, so “aaaccc” is also a valid answer.<br>Note that “cacaca” is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.<br>Example 3:</p><p>Input:<br>“Aabb”</p><p>Output:<br>“bbAa”</p><p>Explanation:<br>“bbaA” is also a valid answer, but “Aabb” is incorrect.<br>Note that ‘A’ and ‘a’ are treated as two different characters.</p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：在cnt数组中保存每个字母出现的次数，然后按照出现次数的顺序对字符串进行排序～</strong></span></p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.</strong></p><p><strong>Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.</strong></p><p><strong>Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.</strong></p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p><strong>Input:</strong><br><strong>[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]</strong></p><p><strong>Output:</strong><br><strong>[5,6]</strong></p><p></p>

<p>Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.</p><p>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.</p><p>Example:<br>Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,</p><p>Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,<br>return [0, 1].<br>UPDATE (2016/2/13):<br>The return format had been changed to zero-based indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.</p><p></p>

<p>Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.</p><p>Example:<br>Given a binary tree<br>1<br>/ \\<br>2 3<br>/ \\<br>4 5<br>Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].</p><p>Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.</p><p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>题目大意：给一个二叉树，计算出任意两个节点中最长的长度并返回结果～</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>分析：计算每个节点的深度，并在dfs过程中将每个节点左边深度+右边深度的值的最大的值保存在ans中返回～</strong></span></p><p> </p>

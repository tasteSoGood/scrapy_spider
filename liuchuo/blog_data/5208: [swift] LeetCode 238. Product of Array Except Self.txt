<p>Given an array of n integers where n &gt; 1, nums, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].</p><p>Solve it without division and in O(n).</p><p>For example, given [1,2,3,4], return [24,12,8,6].</p><p>Follow up:<br>Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (Note: The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)</p><p></p>

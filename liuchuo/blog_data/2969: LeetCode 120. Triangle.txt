<p>Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.</p><p>For example, given the following triangle<br>[<br>[2],<br>[3,4],<br>[6,5,7],<br>[4,1,8,3]<br>]<br>The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).</p><p>Note:<br>Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.</p><p>Â </p>
